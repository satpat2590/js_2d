Description:
I created a 2D platformer where players try to compete for the best time possible. 
During the game, you run and jump on platforms to get to the end of the level, but have
to avoid the enemies and ditches along the way. If you fall into a ditch, you will teleport
a few feet back from where you fell. Additionally, at the start of the game, you can choose
to play as one of four characters I created using a Sprite sheet. 


# Instructions:

To run the game:
1. Before you begin make sure to clone the repository
2. Make sure you have all the proper packages installed by running ```npm ci``` in your terminal.
3. On your terminal run ```node app.js``` or ```nodemon app.js``` if you have nodemon installed.
4. Go to your browser and type in ```localhost:3000```
5. You will see a selection screen where you can choose your character.
6. Once you choose your character and click the start button, you will be taken to the game screen.


# To play the game:

1. Use the arrow keys to move your character.
    - Up arrow key means jump
    - Left arrow key means move left
    - Right arrow key means move right
2. Try to get to the end of the level as fast as possible.
3. If you fall into a ditch, you will be teleported back a few feet.


# Improvements to the game:

1. Add more levels, characters, and enemies
2. Create a server side so the game becomes multiplayer and you can compete with other players
